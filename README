NAME

    Alien::Capstone - Perl extension to install Capstone-Engine from
    www.capstone.org

SYNOPSIS

    Alien::Capstone is a perl module that enables the installation of the
    open source disassembly library Capstone-Engine from
    http://www.capstone-engine.org on the system or locate the existing
    installation if any. It is currently setup to look for version 3.0.4.

    You can use it in the Build.PL file if you're using Module::Build or
    Makefile.PL file if you're using ExtUtils::MakeMaker.

                use Alien::Capstone;
                # ...
                die "Alien::Capstone isn't installed" unless &Alien::Capstone::is_installed();
                # ...
                my $capstone= Alien::Capstone->new;
                my $build = Module::Build->new(
                    ...
                    extra_compiler_flags => $capstone->cflags(),
                    extra_linker_flags => $capstone->libs(),
                    ...
